# reddi-dotnet-react-app
This is the full directory of files after modification from the standard `dot net new react` command was run.

There are a series of [gist files](https://gist.github.com/nissan/0b49d7524f0729e48e4e436d57533883) that show off the individually configured files that are different from the generated template as well as the other commands or `yarn add` of packages run.

# Requirements
1. [ASP.Net Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) installed
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) generator
3. A code editor. For this project I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) but any will do
4. [Optional] [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font which works nicely if you [enable ligatures in VSCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions)

# Quick setup of requirements
You can quickly setup the requirements by running the `setup-prerequisites.sh` or `setup-prerequisites.ps1` that will download and install requirements for you. 
If you'd like to copy my VSCode customized setup as well, install the [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) plugin to VSCode and download my [cloudSettings gist](https://gist.github.com/nissan/1eebdf0c22e31598a8f279bb784f7eb8) as your own using `Settings Sync`.
